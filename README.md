Boldar (Bolet Radar) A python script which scrapes weather records and tries to pinpoint the best area for mushroom hunting

This script will download .csv files from http://www.aemet.es/ to the current directory, and parse them for information about precipitation, wind, temperature, etc.

We plan to add static profiles for each station (altitude, forest types, soil types, etc.) to improve the predictive power of this model.
